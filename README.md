# Advanced Machine Learning (DA633E) Labs resolution

You report should have following instructions: (you can upload a pdf file (contains explanations) + your code in a zip file or a colab notebook with explanation including the following topics)

- How to run your code (especially, if not using notebooks and using other libraries)
- Describe your dataset and explain whether it's a classification or regression problem.
- Any library you are using that we did not cover, so I can download the right one (with the right version!). Appropriate pip commands in your notebooks would be the best.
- Custom folder structures. If I need to download some specific folder from drive or something. Please make sure that how to connect it in the code is clear on how I can change it to assess.
- Anything you think that must be written to complement the code and the report

# Setup

For these labs, [pixi](pixi.sh) was used to manage dependencies and their versions, leveraging the conda ecosystem. TODO make sure macos works as well, and provide instructions.
